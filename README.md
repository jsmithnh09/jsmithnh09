I'm a software engineer and audio tools developer at Bose Corporation in Massachusetts. My principal programming languages are MATLAB and Python, although I'm a huge fan (and novice) with the Julia programming language.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on additions to DSP.jl and a Julia implementation of Empirical Mode Decomposition, EMD.jl.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy Criterion Collection Films, time with friends/family, and Concert going!
